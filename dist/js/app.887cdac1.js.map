         A British casual wear brand with a highly visible logo (the laurel),\\n          Fred Perry has had enduring appeal amongst youth subcultures since the\\n          1960s. The brand produces both tennis clothing and casual street wear\\n          for men and women. Tennis legend Fred Perry created the sweatband in\\n          the 1940’s, and proceeded to design well-fitting tennis clothing which\\n          became immediately popular with top players. The brand evolved from\\n          the initial sports clothing and became popular with various youth\\n          subcultures such as the Mods. The label was the first ever sports to\\n          street wear crossover label, and has continued to make both types of\\n          clothing. The famous Fred Perry shirt is a design classic and has\\n          helped to maintain the visibility and popularity of the brand. The\\n          designs today still feature the trademark laurel leaf stitched logo.\\n          There are knitwear, footwear, accessories and outerwear ranges for\\n          both men and women.

appeal amongst youth subcultures since the\n          1960s. The brand produces both tennis clothing and casual street wear\n          for men and women. Tennis legend Fred Perry created the sweatband in\n          the 1940’s, and proceeded to design well-fitting tennis clothing which\n          became immediately popular with top players. The brand evolved from\n          the initial sports clothing and became popular with various youth\n          subcultures such as the Mods. The label was the first ever sports to\n          street wear crossover label, and has continued to make both types of\n          clothing. The famous Fred Perry shirt is a design classic and has\n          helped to maintain the visibility and popularity of the brand. The\n          designs today still feature the trademark laurel leaf stitched logo.\n          There are knitwear, footwear, accessories and outerwear ranges for\n          both men and women. The label is available in sports and other retail\n          stores worldwide.\n        </p>\n        <div class=\"caption\">\n          <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/fredperry.me\"

PINKO\\n          relies upon research and the quality of Italian handcrafts for\\n          original and astonishing creations that are also easy to wear. Over\\n          the years, PINKO has created a model of a woman that is determined,\\n          feminine, metropolitan, playful and interested in what is happening\\n          around her. Extraordinary image makers such as Alessandra Ambrosio,\\n          Naomi Campbell, Elle MacPherson, Carmen Kass, Eva Herzigova, Terry\\n          Richardson and Steven Klein have contributed to the

contemporary fashion brand with a distinct\n          Italian spirit focused on women clothing. Creative flair and quality\n          are the supporting values expressed through forward-looking\n          collections. Attention to being au courant, attention to technological\n          innovation, spirit of participation and an across-the-board perception\n          of style has sculpted Pinko’s worldwide success over the years. PINKO\n          relies upon research and the quality of Italian handcrafts for\n          original and astonishing creations that are also easy to wear. Over\n          the years, PINKO has created a model of a woman that is determined,\n          feminine, metropolitan, playful and interested in what is happening\n          around her. Extraordinary image makers such as Alessandra Ambrosio,\n          Naomi Campbell, Elle MacPherson, Carmen Kass, Eva Herzigova, Terry\n          Richardson and Steven Klein have contributed to the creation of this\n          model of a woman.\n        </p>\n        <div class=\"caption\">\n          <span>\n            <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/pinkoarabia\" target=\"_blank\"\n
